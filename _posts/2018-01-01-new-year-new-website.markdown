I decided to launch a personal website. Recently I've been getting
experience using a technology called Jekyll. It generates websites
from Markdown text plus layouts and styles. The sites it generates are
static, which for the purposes of this site is entirely adequate. With
the availability of many services for various data needs that used
to be handled by a website backend can now be integrated by front end
javascript. Now, a backend plus database seems like a couple layers of
complexity that are unnecessary for a personal website like you'd find
in Drupal or Wordpress.

Check out [Jekyll] for yourself:
